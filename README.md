# A practical guide towards explainability and bias evaluation in machine learning

This repo contains the full Jupyter Notebook and code for the Python talk on machine learning explainabilty and algorithmic bias. This example uses the following open source libraries:
* <a href="https://github.com/EthicalML/XAI">XAI</a> - We use XAI to showcase data analysis techniques 
* <a href="https://github.com/SeldonIO/Alibi">Alibi</a> - We use Alibi to dive into black box model evaluation techniques 
* <a href="https://github.com/SeldonIO/Seldon-core">Seldon Core</a> - We use seldon core to deploy and serve ML models and ML explainers

You can find the presentation in the following formats:
* [Online slides (Reveal.JS) format](https://ethicalml.github.io/explainability-and-bias/#/)
* [Jupyter notebook to follow code examples](https://github.com/EthicalML/explainability-and-bias/blob/master/Bias%20Evaluation%20%26%20Explainability.ipynb) (If it doesn't load it may be due to size)

         The presentation was performed using the <a href="https://github.com/damianavila/RISE">RISE plugin</a> to convert the Jupyter notebook into a reveal.js presentation. The reveal.js presentation is hosted live in this repo under the <a href="https://ethicalml.github.io/explainability-and-bias/#/1">index.html</a> page.
